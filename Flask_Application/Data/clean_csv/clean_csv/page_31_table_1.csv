"TurfView BI Â– Master Guide V7.0Product Sub Type -Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Productstarting Product Sub-TypeProduct Variant -Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Productstarting Product VariantBase UOM -When a distributor sends an invoiced sales quantity into TurfView, they need to define what the quantity they are sendingrelates to. They do this by sending one of four 'UOM' or ""Unit Of Measure"" codes ('B'= Base,'C'= Case,'P'= Pack,or 'L'= Litres).For example, if the distributor sends a sale for a product which is sold in cases/boxes of 4 x 4 litre bottles (4x4L) and theyhave told us they sold a quantity of ""16""; we need to know if the quantity indicated in the invoice line relates to: 16x ""C""/Cases = 256L, 16x ""P""/ packs = 64L or 16 ""L""/ Litres (16L). The Base UOM is used when the distributor wants to define theirUOM always align to how BP define the default UOM for that product (rather than them defining each time based on howthey invoice), therefore based on how it would have been invoiced to them by BP... In the example of the 4x4L productsthese are typically invoiced by BP to its customers in cases, whereas bulk product is typically sold in Litres.Pack UOM -""UOM"" or ""UOM Code"", this is the tag which accompanies the quantity sold or quantity stocked. There are 4 UOM codes usedin TurfView: C= Case/boxes, P= Pack/bottles, L= Litres, and B= Base- which is the invoiced UOM used by BP. We use this inconjunction with the product quantity in order to determine what the quantity relates to, applying a different UOM to aquantity affects the end volume outcome. For example a 4x4L pack would have the following out comes if a quantity of 1 wasshown: C=16L, P=4L, L=1L, B=16L (because BP sell in case quantity). Without the UOM, the quantity is useless.Pack Factor -'Pack Factor' relates to the number of 'Inners' within a pack of product, for example: Edge 5W-30 LL 12x1L as a SKU, wouldhave a Pack Factor of 12, because it has twelve one litre bottles within its outer/ case packaging.Case UOM -'Case UOM' is a bit like a pack description, it denotes how the unit case volume (and therefore rate of sale is derived by eachcase unit sold) is derived based on the pack size it is sold in. For example, Edge 5W-30 LL 4x4L would have a 'Case UOM' of4x4L which obviously equals 16L in total. Bulk would have a 'Case UOM' of ""BULK LT"" because it is sold by the litre.Case Factor -'Case Factor' relates to the number of 'Inners' within a case of product, for example: Edge 5W-30 LL 12x1L as a SKU, wouldhave a Case Factor of 12, because it has twelve one litre bottles within its outer/ case packaging.Pack Gross Weight (Kg)Gross Weight (in kg) that is contained in one packPack Gross Volume (Ltr)Gross Weight (in Ltr) that is contained in one packPack Net Weight (Kg)Net Weight (in kg) that is contained in one packPack Net Volume (Ltr)Net Weight (in Ltr) that is contained in one packPack SizeThis relates to the packaging the product was sold in.

Where there is no density dataavailable for a given product from the data-source, a flat conversion rate of 1:1 is used (which is the average). This iscommonly used for grease products which need to be converted from a weight to a volume measurement in order to sum upsales or stock totals across multiple products.31",Unnamed: 0
