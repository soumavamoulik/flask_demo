 o that the correct characters are in use for the field type  
o specific business rules related to the field  e.g. not allowing negative COGS  
• Month End Restriction validation will  reject all the data that is outside the valid month range  (transaction data must be dated within a rolling “current 
month or previous two”) . 
TurfView then performs a suite of structured validations on each record and field. In terms of the record and fiel d content, e rrors  generally fall in to three 
categories.  
1. Distributor s ource data or formatting issues sent in the file (e.g. missed fields, erroneous data etc)  
2. Missing Distributor master data resulting in errored transactions e.g. 510 invoices transmitted for a new customer before the 300/400 for the 
customer has been received within TurfView  
3. Mapping issues on BP side e.g. transactions for a new product received before the BP Cluster Admin has loaded the product cod e in TurfView  
A full list of e rror codes, descriptions and suggested actions are available in the latest version of the TVBI – Record Summary and Error List  excel file  
10.2 ERROR REPORTING  
Data Import Error and Data Receipt Status reports are issued for every file which summarizes  record co unts and key transaction dates within the file , the file 
processing status,  and the related errors / error reasons. These are sent to:  
- the BP Administrator ( via the email address configured under BP Admin ID within Distributor Master)  
- the Distributor Admin istrator ( via the email address configured in Company Email of the Distributor Master ). , 
These reports are also available in TurfView under Management Reports, Other Reports.  
10.3 ERROR REJECTION  
If records are rejected, only the failed line items will generate an error. The remaining successful line items in the file w ill be processed accordingly. Corrective 
action will need to be taken accordingly to resolve the errors and reprocess the data. All error records w ill be reprocessed nightly for 3 0 days and will then be 
purged. This gives the opportunity to resolve associated issues e.g.  
- if the erro r relates to a number of 510 Invoice Records that reference a Customer Code for which a 300 record was not received, the 
Distributor can send the 300 record and then all related 510s will  reprocess successfully the following night (and be removed from TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
101 
 the error log). The same would apply for any missing masters (Employee, Warehouse on Distributor side, or P roduct and Geography 
on BP side).  
- if the erro r relates to incorrect source data e.g. field format or truly incorrect data, then replacement records would need to be sent 
and the error  records would be purged after 3 0 days.  
- The BP Admin can also use the Da ta Import Error Maintenance facility within TurfView to selectively purge errors from the error 
table if they know that the records have already been replaced with correct data.  
IMPORTANT NOTE:  Errors related to file structure/format (e.g. wrong file form at, or incorrect filename) are rejected at the file processing level and none 
of the related records will be processed . Such errors will not reflect in the Data Import E rror report but the Distributor will be notified that the File failed.  
10.4 RESOLUTION OPTIONS  
The Distributor can resolve the error in one of two ways:  
1. Sending a replacement record within an ODS or TXT file as usual (via FTP, SFTP or Distributor File Upload tool)  
2. Manipulating the errored record directly using the Data Import Error Maintenan ce tool  within Admin / Admin Tools menu . All existing error r ecords 
are available in this screen. These can be selected and updated and submitted back for re processing. See the “?” instructions within the Data 
Maintenance Tool for more information.

 2.4 SUMMARY OPERATIONAL DATA FLOW  
 
 
2.5 DATA RETENTION  
Distributor data is held for the following periods:  
• TurfView displays all transactions that fall within current year + 2 years history . Each January the 5th year is deleted from the database e.g.,  in 
2023, TurfView will retain 20 21-2023 data. In Jan 20 23, 2020 will be deleted and the period will be 20 21-2023. Please note that any 
transactions received with dates outside of the current range will not be processed.  
• Original Distributor Text files are retained in the secure file system for approx. 3 months before deletion (current month minus 2) . This allows 
for reload in case of incident, avoiding the need for the Distributor to resend the original data.  
• Error records are held in the Data Staging table for 30 days and reprocessed nightly where applicable (see Erro r Handling section)

11 RULES FOR SENDING INCREMENTAL DATA TO TURFVIEW  
 
These rules are recommended for all Distributors . Exceptions can be discussed on a case by case basis during implementation in the relevant market.   
11.1 TRANSACTIONS - STOCK (RECORD TYPE 800)  
 
• TurfView will only update the daily stock position from information contained in the 800 record received. Stock data  is updated on a line by line basis 
by default.  
• Distributor should send one 800 stock record for each SKU (per warehouse) for a particular date. These should preferably be s ent within the same 
file.  
• Changes to stock positions need to be provided in update d 800 record. If no updated position is received for a particular stock line, then TurfView will 
simply carry over the previously reported stock position. Note, this includes the need to send zero stock positions to notify  TurfView that stock is no 
longer held.  
• If no 800 stock records are sent for a particular day, TurfView will carry over previous day’s stock position for all relevan t SKUs.  
• Exceptions to these default processing rules are in place in some markets. Requirements should be communicated to you r BP Cluster Administrator 
for discussion with Nihilent Analytics .   
11.2 TRANSACTIONS – INVOICES , DFF AND PENDING PO (RECORD TYPES 510, 520  AND 900/910 ) 
 
• TurfView will only update sales transactions from information contained in the 510 (Sales Invoice) or 520 (Delivery For Fee) records received. Invoice 
data is updated on a line by line basis  defining uniqueness by  (Customer No / Invoice Date / Invoice Number / Invoice Line No combination) by 
default. If Line No. is missing then it would be (Customer No / Invoi ce Date / Invoice Number / Product Code combination) .  
• In the event of a change to an invoice that has already been processed in TurfView (e.g. for a credit note, or invoice amendm ent), updates will only be 
applied to the specific Invoice Date / Invoice No  / Invoice Line No combination referenced in the 510 record. All other lines for the same invoice 
(where applicable) will remain unaffected. To ensure invoice changes are deployed fully, please ensure that a 510 record is s ent for ALL applicable 
lines of t he invoice that require update.  
• Pending PO (Record 900/910) information should be sent daily to account for any changes in pending products and quantities.  
• Exceptions to these default processing rules are in place in some markets. Requirements should be co mmunicated to your BP Cluster Administrator 
for discussion with Nihilent Analytics . TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
153 
 11.3 MASTER DATA RECORDS  
• Any new master recor ds (Customers, Sales Employees and Warehouses ) must be loaded in TurfView before any associated transactions can be 
loaded. These ca n be sent via ODS or TXT file, or added directly in TurfView  within the relevant Master Data & Standards screen.  
• Once loaded there is no need to resend unless change s occur .  
o Changes can be made by locating the record within the relevant Master Data & Sta ndards screen and editing accordingly.  
o Alternatively if sending via a file, a ny changes to fields within an existing master record require that the entire related record be sent again. 
An example would be a change to the Sub Sector Detail code assigned to a Customer 300 or 400 record. If the Sub Sector Detail Code field  is 
changed,  then the entire 300 or 400 record for this Customer should be sent again to TurfView  to ensure that this is mapped correctly.  
• Sending duplicate records in files will impact system performance and should be avoided.  
 
12 ORDERING PORTAL  (MEXICO)  
12.1 OVERVIEW  
TurfView Ordering Portal is a single page web application that runs on the same environment as TurfViewBI does. The applicati on is used mainly by the 
Castrol lubricant dealers in Mexico to place orders to the distributors. The complete life cycle of an order, till the products are delivered and the distributor 
receives payment, can be tracked in this portal. There are some basic relevant reports available in the platform for the Deal ers, Distributors and the OEM 
users.

 16 COMPETITION LAW - RULES  
16.1 OVERVIEW  
 
In the context of TurfView this relates to restrictions imposed upon BP users of the platform, TurfView automatically restric ts what they can see or access... 
For example in Europe competition law dictates BP could be viewed as a competitor of its distributors (given they operate in similar markets selling the 
same products), therefore BP is not permitted to see data which allows them to work out specific prices the distributor has c harged (includin g SKU level 
financials), or to know the names or identity of the distributor end customers. The restrictions imposed on BP users varies d epending on the country data 
they are viewing in the TurfView platform.

 18 VENDOR MANAGEMENT INVENTORY  (VMI)  
18.1 WHAT IS VMI  
 
 
• A supply chain agreement where the manufacturer or supplier takes control of the inventory decisions for the seller or retailer  
• The upstream agent is responsible for the inventory of the downstream agent  
• Upstream and downstream agents plan collaboratively  
• Focus on quality forecasting; safety stocks, lead time, service level and responsibility of replenishment  
• Implement the  VMI system together  
TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
219 
 • Continuously review the VMI system and identify improvements  
18.2 WHY TURFVIEW IN VMI?  
Benefit of VMI:  
o Improved Fill Rate  
o Increased Accuracy in Planning  
o Less Admin in Order Management  
o Reduced Delivery Cost  
o Lower Inventory Level  
o Efficiency i n E2E  
To achieve this VMI team in Castrol needs few data points from  TurfView to build the feature.  
1. Distributor’s rolling 24 months sell out data  
2. Distributor’s Inventory Data  
3. Distributors  Stock Allocated Volume (Stock, which is present in inventory, but al ready allocated to end customers).  
4. Distributor’s Open Purchase Order (Open Purchase Order, from Distributor to Castrol)  
5. Distributor ABDC classification  at SKU and Warehouse Level  
6. Distributor Product Status

4.2.3  DISTRIBUTOR MASTER  
Below are the details of the fields that needs to be populated to create a Distributor in TurfView – 
 
FIELD NAME  DEFINITIONS  
Code - Every TurfView distributor has a unique ID code "TurfView Distributor Code" this is located within the 
distributor master, it is used whenever we show distributor data in th e platform, it is used when the 
distributor sends data (so we know who it relates to), it is what connects everything to the distributor 
entity in the platform.  
 
ERP Primary Sell To Code – This refers to the code which used by the Distributor in their res pective SAP Systems. The system 
utilizes this code to map the Sell -In Data against the Distributor in the system.  
Whenever there is a change in the ERP Primary Sell To Code for a  distributor, that needs to be updated in 
the Distributor master wit h a comma sep arator.  
 
Distributor Data Model  This field is utilized to denote whether the distributor sends data via the Full/ Lite/ Lite Stock data 
specifications.  
 TurfView Full Data - In order to get the data from our distributors into TurfView, distributors send regular 
flat files (typically in a TXT  or ODS format). These files must comply with a file specification in order to be TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
23 
 successfully inges ted into the platform. We offer 2 incoming data specifications: 'Full Data' which is often 
referred to as "Full Spec", which requires smoother more systematic file transfer, but has greater upfront 
investment in implementation.  
 
TurfView Lite Data - 'Lite Specification', which is far simpler for distributors to set up, but does require 
some ongoing maintenance, also error management with the lite specification can be more onerous to 
resolve. 'Full specification' is always preferred, Lite specification is u sed as a fallback should a distributor 
lack the IT skill or resource to implement full spec. A hybrid can also be used, where distributors send full 
specification data for all data except for stock (referred to as 'Lite Stock' distributors).  
 
Stock Data ( Y/N)  The selection of this field enables the system to identify whether the Distributor will be sending Stock 
Data.  
 
Name  Name of the distributor  
 
Distributor Name (English)  Name of the Distributor in English. This field is required for Distributors whose name has been entered in 
local language or with special characters.  
 
Go-Live Date  This is the date on which the distributor commenced using TurfView for the first time. Typically, this is 
used to determine how long a distributor has be en using TurfView.  
 
Expiry Date  This is the date on which the distributor has stopped using TurfView.  
 
Currency  This field contains the list of currencies

included in OEM Calculations (If the Castrol Sub -Distributor is not listed/Live on TurfView, then you will 
need to create a Distributor Master for them before you can proceed and then map to this)   
 TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
27 
 Included in Ford Reporting  This toggle enables to confirm if the Distributor relates to Ford Customers and should be included in

 All Stock Data  
 All Sales Financials  
 No Exclusion  
 All Sales Data  
 All Data Excluded  
 
Distributor Focus  This field shows the sector the Distributor is Focused on  
 
Data Extraction Method  Whether the data would be extracted Automatically or Manually  
 
Stock Ingestion Method  The stock reporting currently happens on two factors (the field for this is – Stock Ingestion Method)  
 
Quantity Snapshot – When this option is selected for a distributor, it means that the system will only be 
calculating the stock data for a particular month based o nly on the data loaded by the distributor for that 
particular month. Which means when this option is selected, the system will only show the data that has 
been uploaded by the distributor for a particular month. However, if any distributor does not upload any 
stock data for a particular month, in that case the system will automatically calculate the stock data as 0 
for that month and then carry forward to the next months.  
The distributor simply tells us what product they have in stock (nothing more, nothing  less), we will report 
that… If they fail to report something, we will assume it is not in stock anymore!  
 
  
Movements Only – When this option is selected for a distributor, the system carries forward the Stock 
Data for the last month to the current month if any distributor does not upload stock data for a particular 
month. If any distributor uploads any data for the next month, it is then reflected in the system and carried 
forward to the next months.  
The distributor reports only the changes since they las t sent us stock data, I.E. what has reduced or 
increased in quantity, (IMPORTANTLY) including if something has decreased to zero (they must send a 
stock product record with zero vol to tell us).  If they do not send an update for a product using this metho d, 
the system will assume there is no change, therefore the last recorded quantity carries over (forever 
potentially).  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
28 
  
The functionality of the system across markets is similar based on the selection of these options.  
 
If any distributor changes the stock ingestion method, in that case the system starts recording the stock 
calculation according to the current selection.  
 
Sales R3M  This field shows “Yes/No” based on the fact that whether the Distributor has send Sell -Out Data in the 
Last 3 months. If the distributor has send Sell -Out Data in the last 3 months, the system will be showing 
this field as Yes, else it would say “No”.  
If this field shows “No”, then as per system logic, the distributor will be tagged as “Lapsed”.  
 
Last Master Update  This is a system generated field that shows when the master data was last updated  
 
Remarks  If any specific Remark/Comment has to kept about the distributor.  
 
EU Only: Fastscan  This field shows whether consent has been provided by the distributor so that their Data can be sent/used 
for reporting in FastScan.  
At the top of the Distributor Master Screen, the user can see an option “EU Only:FastScan”.  
 
 Additional Configuration for Lite File s: 
 On the Distributor Master page, you will find an option – “Lite File Configuration” . When you click on the configuration link it opens up a pop -up 
where you need to configure how you would send the information in the file.

 4.2.4  PRODUCT  
4.2.4.1  OVERVIEW  
Product or SKU available in the application (created or uploaded) are recorded and visible in this section.  
The Products are created in the system when the user sends a 510 records. However, a product can also be manually created in the system from the 
following page.  
4.2.4.2  PRODUCT CREATION DE TAILS  
The following fields/steps need to be populated to manually create a product  
FIELD NAME  DEFINITIONS  
Search Product - This field is a lookup field that looks in the Product Master that is transferred in the system by the AWS Team from Castrol’ s 
ERP s ystem (Data Lake).  
This field is used to look up in Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic to clone a product  
Code - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the Product Code  
Name - Once the Fusion or Global  SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the Product Name  
Origin Date - Date of creation of the product  
Expiry Date - Date of the expiry of the product  
Master Brand - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Product 
starting Master Brand  
This is at the top of the product hierarchy, it relates to the overall brand the product sits within. For example, Edge sits within 
'Castrol' as a master brand. Vis co sits within 'BP' as a master brand. Supertronic is within 'Aral' as a master brand.  
Product Brand - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Product 
starting Product Brand  
This is a level within the product hierarchy. It is one of the more commonly used segments within the hierarchy as it reflects 
the marketing brand names used within our products. For example the lead brands in auto for Castrol is Edge, Magnatec and 
GTX. Industrial e xamples such as Hysol, Hyspin.  
Product Brand Variant - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Product 
starting Product Brand Variant  
Product Type - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or I SP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Product 
starting Product Type  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
31 
 Product Sub Type - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Product 
starting P roduct Sub -Type  
Product Variant - Once the Fusion or Global SKU or ISP Mnemonic is selected, it will automatically populate the hierarchy of the Product 
starting Product Variant  
Base UOM - When a distributor sends an invoiced sales quantity into TurfView, they need to define what the quantity they are sending 
relates to. They do this by sending one of four 'UOM' or "Unit Of Measure" codes ('B'= Base,'C'= Case,'P'= Pack,or 'L'= Litre s). 
For example, if the distributor sends a sale for a product whi ch is sold in cases/boxes of 4 x 4 litre bottles (4x4L) and they 
have told us they sold a quantity of "16"; we need to know if the quantity indicated in the invoice line relates to: 16x "C"/  
Cases = 256L, 16x "P"/ packs = 64L or 16 "L"/ Litres (16L). The B ase UOM is used when the distributor wants to define their 
UOM always align to how BP define the default UOM for that product (rather than them defining each time based on how 
they invoice), therefore based on how it would have been invoiced to them by BP. .. In the example of the 4x4L products 
these are typically invoiced by BP to its customers in cases, whereas bulk product is typically sold in Litres.  
Pack UOM - "UOM" or "UOM Code", this is the tag which accompanies the quantity sold or quantity stocked.  There are 4 UOM codes used 
in TurfView: C= Case/boxes, P= Pack/bottles, L= Litres, and B= Base - which is the invoiced UOM used by BP. We use this in 
conjunction with the product quantity in order to determine what the quantity relates to, applying a diffe rent UOM to a 
quantity affects the end volume outcome. For example a 4x4L pack would have the following out comes if a quantity of 1 was 
shown: C=16L, P=4L, L=1L, B=16L (because BP sell in case quantity). Without the UOM, the quantity is useless.  
Pack Fac tor - 'Pack Factor' relates to the number of 'Inners' within a pack of product, for example: Edge 5W -30 LL 12x1L as a SKU, would 
have a Pack Factor of 12, because it has twelve one litre bottles within its outer/ case packaging.  
Case UOM - 'Case UOM' is a  bit like a pack description, it denotes how the unit case volume (and therefore rate of sale is derived by each 
case unit sold) is derived based on the pack size it is sold in. For example, Edge 5W -30 LL 4x4L would have a 'Case UOM' of 
4x4L which obviousl y equals 16L in total. Bulk would have a 'Case UOM' of "BULK LT" because it is sold by the litre.  
Case Factor - 'Case Factor' relates to the number of 'Inners' within a case of product, for example: Edge 5W -30 LL 12x1L as a SKU, would 
have a Case Factor o f 12, because it has twelve one litre bottles within its outer/ case packaging.  
Pack Gross Weight (Kg)  Gross Weight (in kg) that is contained in one pack  
Pack Gross Volume (Ltr)  Gross Weight (in Ltr) that is contained in one pack  
Pack Net Weight (Kg) Net Weight (in kg) that is contained in one pack  
Pack Net Volume (Ltr)  Net Weight (in Ltr) that is contained in one pack  
Pack Size  This relates to the packaging the product was sold in. For example Edge 5W -30 LL is filled in Bulk, 208L, 60L, 20L 4x4 L, 12x1L 
(a range of pack sizes).  
Density  This is a number which is used when converting a product from a weight to a volume measurement (or visa -versa), it is the 
conversion rate at which the product is converted from 1 kilo to litres or from LB to gallo ns. Where there is no density data 
available for a given product from the data -source, a flat conversion rate of 1:1 is used (which is the average). This is 
commonly used for grease products which need to be converted from a weight to a volume measurement in order to sum up 
sales or stock totals across multiple products.

 4.2.5  NON -INVENTORY PRODUCT  
This typically relates to the sale of products which are non -lubes, for example Castrol Merchandise or equipment such as caps/ t -shirts, pens etc or 
barrel pumps, oi l jugs etc etc. These are reported as standard within the 510 record, they are tagged as non -inventory by putting an 'N' identifier 
within the product type column. Non -inventory products need to be set up in the master data screens by the BP admin.

Code - Provide the code for the Non -Inventory Product  
Name - Provide the name of the Non -Inventory Product

Base UOM  When a distributor sends an invoiced sales quantity into TurfView, they need to define what the quantity they are sending 
relates to. They do this by sending one of four 'UOM' or "Unit Of Measure " codes ('B'= Base,'C'= Case,'P'= Pack,or 'L'= Litres). 
For example, if the distributor sends a sale for a product which is sold in cases/boxes of 4 x 4 litre bottles (4x4L) and the y 
have told us they sold a quantity of "16"; we need to know if the quantit y indicated in the invoice line relates to: 16x "C"/ 
Cases = 256L, 16x "P"/ packs = 64L or 16 "L"/ Litres (16L). The Base UOM is used when the distributor wants to define their 
UOM always align to how BP define the default UOM for that product (rather than  them defining each time based on how 
they invoice), therefore based on how it would have been invoiced to them by BP... In the example of the 4x4L products 
these are typically invoiced by BP to its customers in cases, whereas bulk product is typically sol d in Litres.  
Pack UOM  The Pack  UOM is used when the distributor wants to define their UOM always align to how BP define the default UOM for 
that product  
Pack Factor  Pack  Factor relates to the number of 'Inners' within a pack  of product,  
Remarks  Provide additional remarks if any.  
 
4.2.6  SCHEME

4.3.1.5  CUSTOMER ATTRIBUTE MAPPING  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
39 
 Customer attributes are bespoke customer classification codes which can be applied alongside the existing SSD classification codes. They are 
typically used when there is no SSD  which covers the classification requirements within the SSD codes, or if a specific group of customers need to 
be tracked for incentive programs/ rebates etc.  
The attributes are of two types – 
o Parent Attributes  
o Child Attributes  
 
o Parent Attributes – 
 
Parent attributes typically applies to 'Customer Attributes' . 
Within Customer Attributes  there is a 2 level hierarchy.  
The parent attribute can house up to 10 children attributes, each cluster typically has a maximum of 10 parents. Customer Attributes can 
be used to track specific groups of customers in order to manage sales incentives for example, or pay rebates only relating t o a specific 
customer set. In countries where BP are not permitted to see the end customer name/ identity these attr ibutes can be used to group a 
number of anonymous customers together to form a new classification grouping where none currently exists but is needed for re porting 
purposes.  
 
o Child Attributes –  
 
Child attributes typically applies to 'Customer Attributes'  which signifies a group that is assigned to a customer that can later on be used 
together to form a new classification grouping where none currently exists but is needed for reporting purposes.   
Customer Attributes can be used to track specific groups of cu stomers in order to manage sales incentives for example, or pay rebates 
only relating to a specific customer set. In countries where BP are not permitted to see the end customer name/ identity thes e attributes 
can be used to group a number of anonymous cus tomers together to form a new classification grouping where none currently exists but 
is needed for reporting purposes.

 There is a group of Customers that belong to Vol vo and it has been decided that Rebates would be provided to all Volvo c ustomers. In 
that case the customers who belong to the same group need to have their Customer Attributes selected as Volvo so that when reporting 
for Rebate calculat ion, it would tag all customers correctly. Now to update the customer attribute to Volvo, f irst the parent attribute 
needs to be selected which here would be ‘OEM’ and then from the list of child attributes under OEM, Volvo needs to be select ed.

 6 DATA TRANSMISSION - GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
6.1 OVERVIEW  
▪ Data should be BP/Castrol Lubricants business only . Non -Lubes, or Competitor business should not be sent and will not be accepted or 
processed.  
▪ TurfView will never access or connect directly with the Distributor system. The Distributor should extract data and push to TurfView for 
processing.  
▪ Transmitted data files must follow a predefined and fixed file format. This is described in full in this document.  
▪ In accordance with Data Protection laws , no employee or customer personal data should be transmitted to TurfView through the file transmissio n 
described in this document. Personal data can be defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural  person (for example 
name and address).  
▪ Always refer to the latest version of the TVBI – Record Summary and Error List  excel file  for the record/field structures within the UNICODE Text 
file. 
▪ Distributor should provide data  on an incremental basis  following initial full load. Duplicate data should not be sent. Incremental d ata should be 
sent daily (normally after local business close) to ensure that the latest information is available in TurfView . 
▪ Data is usually available in TurfView on a D+1 basis i.e. once data is received from the Distributor, it is processed by TurfView and available next 
day.  
▪ A Month End Restriction  is imposed on the system .  
o If the Distributo r is included in OEM reporting, Previo us M onth closes on the 6th of the Current Month . The BP Cluster Administrator will 
confirm to Distributors if this applies.  
o For all other Distributor,  the system will only accept transactions dated in Current Month or preceding 2 months .  
o This restriction will be applied for transaction record types 510, 520, 800, 900/910.  
o The BP Cluster Admin istrator  has the privilege to set the restriction even closer  if viable .  However , they cannot extend it.  
o The restriction can be temporarily lifted to handle exceptional events e.g. if history data needs to be resent due to system issues . This 
needs to be requested by the BP Cluster Administrator via a support ticket.  
▪ If there are errors with the file format or structure, then the entire file (and all records within) will be rejected.  
▪ Within the file, any successful records will process and only the erroneous records will be held back and reported in the  Data Error Report.  
6.2 DISTRIBUTOR FILE STRUCTURE  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
47 
 6.2.1  FULL FILE STRUCTURE  
TurfView can accept f iles in one of two methods:   
1. Text File (*.TXT)  
 
• Text file in  UNICODE  encoding format. UTF -16LE is the preferred encoding but the system has also been tested for UTF -8. Non -English 
characters may experience issues and cannot be guaranteed where Unicode format is not used (e.g. ANSI).  
• Must use Pipe “|” delimiters to separat e columns/fields. Every record line must end with a closing “|”.  
 
2. OpenDocument Spreadsheet (*.ODS)  
 
• The ODS template is available within the TurfView Document Repository and can be provided by your BP Cluster Admin . 
• Pipe delimiters are not required as the ODS file is already in tabular format  
6.2.2  LITE FILE STRUCTURE  
TurfView can accept files the followin g methods:  
1. OpenDocument Spreadsheet (*.ODS)  
 
• The ODS template to be used is defined in the Lite File Configuration Page in the Distributor which is specific to every Lite Distributor  
• Pipe delimiters are not required as the ODS file is already in tabular f ormat  
 
6.3 FILE NAMING CONVENTION  
6.3.1  FULL FILE NAMING  CONVENTION  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
48 
 Regardless of the file type used, the f ile name must follow  a specific Distributor Code _yyyymmddnn  convention and will be rejected if it does not 
comply:  
- Distributor Code  = Distributor Code set with in TurfView (BP Cluster Admin should set this up in Distributor Master and provide code 
to the Distributor. The code used should match the Sell -To code for the Distributor in the primary BP ERP system)  
- _yyyymmdd  = year/month/date of file transmission in this exact format  
- nn = File serial no ( e.g. 01 for first file, 02 for second file etc). This is used to denote file sequence of files sent on a  particular day . 
- Example: 12345678_20160125 01.txt  or 12345678_2016012501.ods  
 
6.3.2  LITE FILE NAMING CONVENTION  
The f ile name  for Lite Files  must follow  the following  convention  (based on File Type)  and will be rejected if it does not comply:  
➢ Sales File – Distributor Code_Sale_YYYYMM  
➢ Stock File - Distributor Code_Stock_YYYYMM  
- Distributor Code  = Distributor Code set with in TurfView (BP Cluster Admin should set this up in Distributor Master and provide  code 
to the Distributor. The code used should match the Sell -To code for the Distributor in the primary BP ERP system)  
- _yyyymm  = year/month of file transmission in this exact format  
- Example: 12345678_ Sale_ 201601 .ods or 12345678_ Stock_ 201601.ods  
➢ However, i f a distributor sends more than one file in a month and the Lite File Sending Frequency is selected as high, then the following naming 
convention is to be used – 
- Sales File : DBCode_Sale_yymmdd_n  
- Stock File: DBCode_Stock_yymmdd_n  
In the above structure ‘n’ indicates the file serial no.  
 
6.4 FILE SENDING CONVENTION  
6.4.1  FULL FILE SENDING RULES  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
49 
 The files for Full Distributors can be uploaded daily, weekly, monthly  based on the Distributor’s decision.  
6.4.2  LITE  FILE SENDING RULES  
The file for Lite Distributors can be daily or monthly. In normal scenario, the file sending frequency for Lite File is one file per month containing the 
data for the entire month.  
How ever, the frequency can be updated to daily  via a request to the Nihilen t Support Team who can update the file sending frequency.  
 
 
6.5 GOVERNING RULES FOR RECORDS AND FIELDS  
• File can contain one, some, or all record types as applicable at the time of transmission. Each file does not need to contain  every record type.  
• Only new or changed records to be sent . This applies to both Master and Transaction records.  File must not  contain previously sent transactions 
or masters, unless they are specifically updated records e.g. a change to a master, or a correction to previously rejecte d records.  
▪ Each record must always  commence with the fixed record  number e.g. 510 is always used to denote a Sales Invoice record type.  
▪ The next field in the record (Column 1) will always  display the unique Distributor code provided by BP for the Distribut or entity in TurfView. A file 
should contain the same Distributor Code on all records. O nly the records t hat match with the Distributor  Code given in the file name will be 
accepted and all other records with different distributor codes will be rejected.  
▪ All remaining fields (Column 2 onwards) indicate specific fields for specific records and are described a ccordingly in the next sections.  
2. Master data record should always be sent pr ior to any Transactional record (to ensure that transactions can be mapped a gainst Customers, Sales 
Employees, Warehouses and Sales Areas accordingly). If contained in the same file, TurfView will always process Masters befor e Transactions.  If 
sending separate files, use the File Serial no to sequence masters before transactions ( e.g. masters sent in file 01, transactions sent in file 02)  
3. Nullable fields are non -mandatory fields. Within the specification:  
- Nullable field = N  is a mandatory field  
- Nullable field = Y  means it is not a mandatory field . Consideration should still be made whether the data should be sent, even if optional.  
- Nulled Fields should be blank and should not contain  a space  character i.e. “||”, not “| |”.  
▪ NVARCHAR Code fields (e.g. Customer Code, Product Code, Distributor Code, Wa rehouse Code) must contain only the following characters  
- Alpha characters A – Z TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0

 - Numeric characters 0 – 9 
- Special characters # _ - / and . only   
- Code can contain “Space” character in the middle. Leading or trailing “Space” will be trimmed.  
▪ All Codes should be in CAPITALS. Anything sent / entered in lower case is automatically converted to uppercase by TurfView.  
▪ All C odes should be preferably in ENGLISH only. RUSSIAN or GERMAN characters are accepted in special cases.  
4. NUMBER fields must be numeric only.  
- Decimal places must use “.” or “,” and can be up to 4 places. Example: |10.5028| or |10,5028| not |10.50282|  
- Must never have ‘000 separator. Any ‘.’ Or ‘,’ will be considered as decimal only.  
- Positive numbers must not include ‘+’. Negative numbe rs should be prefixed with ‘ -‘. 
5. All unnecessary space characters (trailing and leading) should be trimmed in fields before sending data to TurfView.  
- Codes with internal space characters (e.g. sending a 300 Record with Customer Code as “123 4 ”) will be loaded as such, and will need to 
be referenced exactly in any related record e.g. if an Invoice 510 Record references “1234” , the system will consider this as a different 
code to “123 4” and will not match Invoice to the above Customer.  
- Where sp aces exist withi n fields these will be included in the character count e.g. if a field is NVARCHAR(4) and the field contains “123 4” 
this will be rejected as it is 5 characters in length.  
6. Where applicable, negative s ign must always precede the numeric valu e. Example: | -150| not |150 -| 
7. DATE  field format:  
- Date should be in day month year  sequence  
- Date s eparators ca n be either '.'  ' -' or '/' format. Regardless of how received, the system will convert data format to  '/' 
- d will be converted to dd, m to mm & yy to yyyy  
▪ Year: if yy >= 30 then 19yy & if yy < 30 then 20yy  
6.6 TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND THE TURFVIEW CLUSTER PRODUCT M ASTER  
This section describes how Product data is maintained within TurfView, how Distributors report related sale or stock transactions of BP/Castrol 
Lubricants, and how TurfView stores and reports the related volumes.  It is essential that this is fully understood to avoid misreporting of volumes in 
TurfView.  
6.6.1  TURFVIEW CLUSTER PR ODUCT MASTER  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
51 
 The BP Cluster Administrator is resp onsible for loading and maintaining all of the relevant products that are sold in the associated market. The 
Product Master contains all associated information for the product (code, description, units of measure, status, associated p roduct family etc). Th e 
core information relevant to transactions are as follows:  
Field Name  Description  
Product Code  Essential as it is the unique reference for TurfView to map products received in Distributor transaction files  
Base UOM  This is the base unit of measure for the product e.g. Litres or Kilogram  
Pack Factor  How many Base UoM (e.g. Litres ) are in a single Pack / Selling Unit e.g. if it is a 5 litre bottle and Base UoM is 
Litres , then Pack Factor would be 5 . If there is no “Pack” e.g. bulk, then this is defaulted to 1 to indicate that 
Pack and Base UoM are identical.  
Case Factor  How many Packs are in a single Case e.g. a 12 x1 case/carton would be 12 . Where Cases are not applicable 
(e.g. drums or bulk), then this is defaulted to 1 to means that Pack and Case are identical.  
Pack Net Volume (Ltrs)  This is the Net Volume in Litres related to 1 Pack  
6.6.2  DISTRIBUTOR T RANSACTION TYPES  
Transactions are report ed by Distributors through the following records:  
• Record 510 - Invoice Data  
• Record 520 - Delivery For Fee  
• Record 800 - Stock Data  
• Record 900 or 910 - Pending Purchase Order  
6.6.3  RELEVANT FI ELDS FOR REPORTING TRANSACTION V OLUME  
In each of the relevant Distributor transaction records, there are three key fields that dictate the transaction volume.  
Field Name  Description  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
52 
 Product Code  This must be the BP SKU code, not the Distributor SKU code. This is essential for TurfView to be able to 
recognise the code and to look up the associated values for this product such as description, units of 
measure, product family.  
Volume (or Volume Sold)  This is the absolute quantity and is connected to the Volume Identifier below  
Volume Identifier  This is the indicator which tells TurfView how to translate  the Volume into a real value for the specific 
Product . There are 7 options which are B, P, C , G, K, D  or L. No other character will be accepted in this field.

6.6.4  HOW TURFVIEW STORES AND REPORTS TRANSACTION VOLUMES  
Regardless of which Volume Identifier is used (B, P, C, L , G, K, D ), TurfView normalises and stores the sales and stock data received in Packs only . The 
Packs are then converted into Litres  using Pack Net Volume (Ltr) . TurfView reports are standardised in Litres or Packs by default  (the exception being 
USA & Canada that report in US Gallon and Packs) .  
To normalise the transactions into Packs, the volumes are converted as follows:  
Volume Identifier 
Used in Distributor 
transaction  TurfView Formula for Conversion into Packs  
B Volume Reported divided by  Pack Factor  
P Volume Reported  
C Volume Reported multiplied by  Case Factor  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0

 L Volume Reported divided by  Pack Net Volume (Ltr)  
G (Volume Reported  multiply  Gallon Factor) divided by  Pack Net Volume (Ltr)  
K (Volume Reported  divided by  Density ) divided by  Pack Net Volume (Ltr)  
D ((Volume Reported  multiply  Pound Factor ) / divided by  Density ) / divided by  Pack Net Volume (Ltr)  
6.7 CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION  
Allocating market segmentation to Distributors’ Customer is a vital component to TurfView success. Accurate segmentation generates detailed insight 
into performance of Lubricants within particular sectors, and drives greater efficiency in marketing campaigns and resource a llocation.  
BP has global standards for market segmentation. There are four levels to the hierarchy:  
• Sales Channel e.g. Auto  
• Market e.g. Workshop  
• Sector e.g. Franchised / authorised Workshop or dealer  
• Sub Sector e.g. Car 
• Sub Sector Detail  e.g. VW -AUDI Franchised Car Workshop  
Relation  
The Distributor is required to map their BP/Castrol Lu bricants’ Customers to a Sub Sector Detail (SSD). Each SSD has a unique code, and a list of 
relevant codes will be provided to the Distributor as part of implementation.  
Segmentation is always attached to the Customer outlet / Ship To as this is ultimatel y the delivery point for the product and provides the most 
accurate analysis. However,  there are two methods  for allocating this segmentation to the Customer Ship To. The options should be reviewed and the 
method agreed with the BP Cluster Administrator at  the start of the implementation.  
1. At Sell -To Level . This means that the Customer entity is allocated a Sub Sector Detail, and this will be cascaded to all Ship To locations 
(outlets) associated with the Customer. Sub Sector Detail should be provided in the 300 Record  and will only be recognised  from the 3 00 
Record even if segmentation is also sent in any related 400 Record . See 300 Record section in this document.   TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
55 
 Note: Automatically creating 400 Record Ship Location 1 from the 300 Record. I f Sell To is selected for the Distributor, then the system can 
also create Shipping Location Serial No 1 for the Customer 300 Record as long as the Sub Sector Detail and Sales Area / Geograp hy Level 3 
fields are populated in the 300 Record.  This is useful if the Distributor has a large volume of single location customer s. 
2. At Ship -To Level . This means that the Distributor should allocate a Sub Sector Detail to each individual Ship To location directly. Sub Secto r 
Detail should therefore be provided in the 400 Record  and TurfView  will only recognise SSD in the 400 Record e ven if segmentation was 
provided at the 300 Record level . This provides greater granularity as it means that one Customer group can have different segmentations 
across multiple outlets (e.g. if one outlet services Ford, and another outlet services Volvo). See 400 Record section in this document.  
Note: If Ship To Level is selected, 400 record s must be provided for every  associated Customer 300 Record. Shipping Location Serial No 1 
will not be created automatically from the Customer 300 Record .  
Whichever me thod is agreed, the Sub Sector Detail  field  for the corresponding record type (300 or 400) will be mandatory.  Sub Sector Detail code 
should be provided without preceding “G_”. Any customers sent with null field  or Wrong  for Sub Sector De tail will be defaul ted to the BIGS_NYC 
code. The BP Cluster Admin and Distributor Business Managers regularly review G_BIGS_NYC for resolution. See Section 6 for mo re information.  
6.8 ALLOCATING CUSTOMERS TO A GEOGRAPHY  
Geographical analysis is another critical dimension  in analysing product performance in the market place. Geography is always allocated at the 
Customer outlet / Ship To as this is ultimately the delivery point for the product and provides the most accurate analysis.  
6.8.1  TYPES OF GEOGRAPHY  
Each TurfVi ew Cluster has three hierarchical levels of Geography available. The BP Cluster Administrator will define these  in the TurfView Cluster  for 
the specific market requirements. An example could be:  
• Geography Level 1 – Country  
• Geography Level 2 – State / Provi nce (each Level 2 entry would tie to a single Level 1 entry)  
• Geography Level 3 – City / Town  (each Level 3 entry would tie to a single Level 2 entry)  
• Regardless of the 3  specific  levels determined by the Cluster, the Cluster Administrator must also tie Lev el 1 Geography to a standard 
Alpha 3 country code according to ISO 3166 -1. This ensures that roll up to country can always be achieved.   TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
56 
 Each L evel will have a number of individual entries  and each of these will have a reference name and an associated uniq ue code. The Level 3 codes 
will be provided to the Distributor and the minimum requirement is for the Distributor to assign a Level 3  code to each Customer (see next section 
on how to allocate these codes).  
Please note: Although Level 3 codes are normally  sufficient granularity for geographical analysis, the Clusters also have an option to use a 4th Level  of 
Geography entitled Distributor Sales Area . This is defined through the 100 Sales Area Record sent by the Distributor and allows the Distributor to 
break the Level 3 into separate sales areas. For example, if Level 3 is Birmingham, then potentially the Distributor may have sa les areas for 
Birmingham North, Birmingham South. In this case, the Distributor would send 2 x 100 Records defining entries (name a nd code) for Birmingham 
North and Birmingham South and linking these to Level 3 Birmingham. See the relevant 100 Record section below.  
If Distributor Sales Area s are in use, then these codes must  be provided in the Geography fields of the Customer records,  and not Level 3 
Geography  codes . 
Use of Distributor Sales Area must be defined at the Cluster Level, and will be applicable for ALL Distributors in the Cluster. Please consult w ith 
your BP Cluster Administrator to confirm if these are applicable for your Cluster.  
6.8.2  ALLOCATING GEOGRAPHY CODES  
There are two methods for allocating the relevant Geography Level 3 code or Distri butor Sales Area code.  
1. At Customer Ship To level within the Customer 400 Record in Column 4. This is the most common method. See Reco rd 400 section below.  
2. At Customer Sell To level within the Customer 300 Record. This method should only be used if the Customer only has one associ ated outlet 
as TurfView can create the primary 400 Record (Ship Serial No 1) on the Distributor’s behalf usin g the information provided in the 300 
Record. See Record 300 section below.

 7.5.2  CUSTOMER DATA (RECORD TYPE 300)  
▪ This record relates to the Distributor’s end Customers at a Sold To level. Every Customer must have a 300 Record.  
▪ Customer records can be received / managed in two ways:  
o through the Transmission File or  
o created / edited directly by the Distributor within TurfView within Master Data & Standards, Distributor,  Customer screen  
▪ Customers must be only related to BP/Castrol Lubricants business (not any competitor customers, or other BP lines of business  e.g. Fu els) 
▪ In accordance with Data Protection laws, personal information related to individuals (i.e. business to consumer sales, rather  than business to 
business sales) should not be sent to TurfView. Where the customer is an individual, the Distributor should use a generic name to define this 
customer. Examples could be "CONSUMER", "B2C SALE", or "OTC".  The Customer Name field is mandatory so the field cannot be left null. See the 
File Specification for more information.  
▪ Every  Customer must be assigned a Sub Se ctor Detail code (codes provided by BP) to define their market segmentation. This is always at the 400 
Ship To Level but can be assigned through the 300 Record depending on the set up agreed. Please consult with your Cluster Administrator to 
agree whether segmentation should be assigned through the 300 or 400 Record . See Customer S egment ation  for more detail.  
▪ The Sales Area Code in Column13 is same as the area code captured by data f rom Record Type 100. If Record Type 100 is not applicable in the 
Cluster, then the relevant Geography Level 3 Code should be used in Column13. Geography Level 3 codes are generated by the BP  Cluster Admin 
for your market. Please liaise with your BP Cluster  Admin to locate the relevant codes for mapping.  
▪ If the Customers of a D istributor only have ONE Ship To  address each, then Column13 (Sales Area Code) can be used to define the geography of 
the Customer instead of having to define and send a corresponding 400 record (Customer Shipping Data) . This is only valid if:  
o Segmentation Type for this Distributor is defined as “Sell To” and Column4 (SSD) is populated. See Customer Segmentation  for more 
detail.  
o Column13 (Sales Area Code / Geog Level 3) is populated to define the geographical location of the customer.  In absence of this, the 
system will not generate the standard Customer Shipping Location.  
o If so TurfView will automatically  create a 400 record from the 300 Record for this customer and assign this as Shipping Address Sl No 1 .  
o Note: If the Distributor chooses to provide a separate 400 record for Ship Serial No 1 , then this will  take precedence  over the 
automatically created Ship Serial No 1 above . 
▪ Note : Delivery For Fee Customers (i.e. BP not Distributor customers) can also be sent to TurfView. These will only be validated against the DFF 
transaction (520 Record) if the Customer Code field in t he 520 Record is populated. DFF transactions will only appear in agreed DFF reports.  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0

7.5.3  CUSTOMER SHIPPING DATA (RECORD TYPE 400)  
 
▪ Customer Shipping Locations (Ship To) are sent through this record type  and underpin the Customer 300 Record (Sold To) . Every customer must 
have at least one Ship To location  as geography and segmentation is mapped at this level . See conditions above.  
▪ Customer records can be received / managed in two ways:  
o through the Transmission File or  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
66 
 o created / edited directly by the Distributor within TurfView within Master Data & Standards, Distributor,  Customer screen  
▪ Every  Customer must be assigned a Sub Sector Detail code (codes provided by BP) to define their market segmentation. This is always at the 400 
Ship To Level but can be assigned through the 300 Record depending on the set up agreed. Please consult with your Clus ter Administrator to 
agree whether segmentation should be assigned through the 300 or 400 Record. See Customer Segmentation  for more detail.  
▪ Sending a 400 Record for each Customer outlet / Ship To is mandatory. However, if any  Customers of the Distributor have only ONE  shipping 
address each, then TurfVi ew can create the 400 record on the Distributor’s behalf.  In this case , Column4 and Column13 of Record 300 must be 
populated to give TurfView the required segmentation and geography information to create the 400 record . This 400 Record will always be 
assigned as Ship Serial No 1 for the Customer.  
▪ The Sales Area C ode is the same as the area code captured by data from Re cord Type 100. If Record Type 100 is not applicable in the Cluster, then 
the relevant Geography Level 3 Code should be used as the Sales Area Code. Geography Level 3 codes are generated by the BP Cluster Admin for 
your market. Please lia ise with your BP Cl uster Admin to locate the relevant codes for mapping.

 ▪ This record tracks Pending Purchase Orders between Distributor and BP for stock that is not yet fully received at the Distrib utor site (and 
therefore not registered as Stock in the 800 record). This is related to each valid Warehouse.  
▪ This record is only required if the Distributor is implementing the Distributor Replenishment Model as Pending Orders will need to be consid ered 
when suggesting the volume of SKUs required to replenish for each Warehouse.  
▪ Please also review the 910 Record  as an alternative.  900 and 910 are interchangeable and only one record type should be used .

7.5.9  PENDING PURCHASE ORDER DATA  – ALTERNATIVE (RECORD TYPE 910)  
The 910  is an alternative, simplified method to send Pending Purchase Order Data  for DRM. In this record type : 
• There is no tracking of PO number  
• One 910 should be sent for each SKU / Warehouse combination and should be sent in full every day. If one SKU is purchased from multiple supply 
points  for one warehouse , then TurfView can receive one 910 record for each supply point and will aggregate the total pending order quantity for 
this SKU / Warehouse combination when calculating the suggested order.  
• Each day, TurfView will check for new 910 records received from the Distributor.  
o If no 910 records received, it will retain the existing 910 data in the system.  
o For a particular warehouse if any 910 records are received, then all existing 910 data for that warehouse is purged and replaced with the 
new data received. It is therefore essential to ensure that the 910s s ent reflect all pending orders . Note, d eletion of PO data is warehouse 
specific . TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
81 
 Product 
Code  • Note: Any error record for Pending Purchase Order  (910) will no t be reprocessed and all the existing 910 errors will always get deleted from the 
system. The errors will not be available in the Data Import Error  report.

Notes : 
❖ Once the UOM is selected, this cannot be changed. To change the selected UOM, the user needs to contact the Support Team.  
❖ Litres would be default populated for this field.  
❖ Based on the UOM selected in the Distributor Master, the data would be populated in the Data Accuracy Dashboard.  
❖ To compare between actual sales/stock data reported with the data reported via 999, the system will calculate  the reported sales/stock by 
converting in the reported UOM for 999.  
❖ The above conversion will only take place for displaying in Data Accuracy Dashboard.  
❖ Additional fields will be included in the ‘Validation Records’ tab in Data Accuracy Dashboard which wi ll show the UOM that is being used as a 
reference to validate.  
❖ Additional field will be included in the Data Accuracy Export which will show the UOM that is being used as a reference to va lidate.

9 DISTRIBUTOR FILE TRANSMISSION  
9.1 TEST FILES  
During implementation, test files (TXT or ODS) should be created by the Distributor with agreed data and emailed to the BP Cluster Administrator for action.  
Test files can be uploaded or sent for testing only afte r Distributor has been created in the Distributor Master (Live) and Nihilent Analytics  has been requested 
to set up the Distributor in the Test environment. There are a number of tools available in the Test environment:  
1. File Pre-Validation Tool  – this is u sed to  provide instant feedback on basic structural aspects such as filename, file structure, record structure, 
mandatory fields. This is a useful precursor to the full File Testing process.  
2. File Testing Automation Tool – this is to submit the file through the full testing workflow and perform a comprehensive suite of record validations . 
Note this tool can only accommodate files up to 2MB in size.  
There is also a dedicated Nihilent Analytics  email turfviewtest@nihilentanalytics.com  when the File Testing Automation Tool cannot be used e.g. if file size is 
over 2 MB.  
Submitted t est files will be processed on a n overnight  schedule . Once processed , the system  will send an automated Data Import Error report to nominated 
email addresses for the BP Cluster Admin and Distributor . The Distributor should lia ise with the BP Cluster Admin to resolve any issues and agree actions for TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
98 
 next Test file . This pro cess should repeat until all issues are resolved and data quality is confirmed.  Testing should be signed off before the Distributor can go -
live on TurfView.  
Before processing a test file, all existing test data for the Distributor will be purged. It is the refore essential that all record types are represented in every  test 
file to ensure that all relevant master records are present (e.g. 200 Sales Employee, 300/400 Customer, 700 Warehouse) for re ference by associated test 
transaction records (510 Invoice, 8 00 Stock, 910 Pending PO etc).  
Please conta ct your BP Cluster Admin  for the full test & deployment process. Distributor access to the Test Environment can also be granted on request.  
9.2 LIVE FILES  
Once file testing has completed and is signed off by BP and D istributor, the Distributor must ready their systems to commence transfer of live data files, 
commencing with the full agreed transaction history and related master data.  
TurfView offers three solutions for File Transfer to the Live system. These are described below. The BP Admin should discuss these options with you during 
the test phase in readiness for launch.  
9.2.1  FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)  
This is the default method. At point of go -live, Nihilent will create a username and password to a specific secu re folder on the TurfView Live environment at 
ftp.castrolturfview.com  . This will be provided to the Distributor to configure access and transmit files to this address via an F TP client (normally on a schedule 
from the source system).  
Please note that this transmission is always “push” from the Distributor side. TurfView is not able to access the Distributor system . 
9.2.2  SECURE FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (SFTP)  
This is similar to the ab ove, with the exception that data is encrypted  before transmission and decrypted  upon receipt at TurfView. To ensure that TurfView 
can decrypt the file successfully, t he following process must be followed : 
1. Nihilent Analytics IT Team will create a Windows I D in the SFTP Server (e.g. tvltestuser). This windows ID is required to allow the Distributor access to 
one specific folder on the SFTP server and no other folder (e.g. d: \sftp\tvltestuser).  TurfView BI – Master Guide  V7.0 
99 
 2. The Distributor  is then requested to  generate a Public Key on SFT P client and share it with Nihilent Analytics IT Team. Note, TurfView does not 
mandate any specific SFTP client for this interface. Please see attached a summary process for creating the public key.  
Process for 
generating the public and private key.docx
 
3. Nihilent Analytics IT Tea m will configure the public key for the user create in Step 1 (e.g. tvltestuser).  
4. The Distributor needs to use the user name on the SFTP client followed by the SFTP server IP/DNS name to connect the SFTP ser ver (e.g. 
tvltestuser@sftp.castrolturfview.com )  
5. The user will be granted access once the public key stored in the SFTP server gets the matching private key stored in the use r’s machine.  
9.2.3  DIRECT UPLOAD WITHIN TURFVIEW  
The Live system also provides a facility for Distributors to load ODS or TXT files direc tly. These can be found within the Admin / Admin Tools menu.  
1. File Pre -Validation Tool  – similar to the feature in Test, this is used to provide instant feedback on basic structural aspects such as filename, file 
structure, record structure, mandatory field s. This is a useful precursor to the Distributor File Upload feature below . 
2. Distributor File Upload – this can used to submit one / multiple files directly  into the nightly processing queue. Note this tool can only accommodate 
files up to 2MB in size.  
10 ERROR HANDLING  
10.1 VALIDATIONS  
TurfView performs a number of validations on receipt of the file:  
• Valid filename and Distributor Code  
• Valid file structure/format  
• That each record contains the corresponding Distributor Code in Column 1  
• Specific validations for e ach Record Type and associated fields e.g.  
o that all mandatory fields are populated
